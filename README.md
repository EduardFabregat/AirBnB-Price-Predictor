# AirBnB-Price-Predictor

http://insideairbnb.com

Airbnb claims to be part of the "sharing economy" and disrupting the hotel industry. However, data shows that the majority of Airbnb listings in most cities are entire homes, many of which are rented all year round - disrupting housing and communities.

By analyzing publicly available information about a city's Airbnb's listings, we can see how Airbnb is being used to compete with the residential housing market.

We can ask fundamental questions about Airbnb in any neighbourhood, or across the city as a whole. Questions such as:

    How many listings are in my neighbourhood and where are they?

    How many houses and apartments are being rented out frequently to tourists and not to long-term residents?

    How much are hosts making from renting to tourists (compare that to long-term rentals)?

    Which hosts are running a business with multiple listings and where they?

    Can we create a model that predicts prices?
